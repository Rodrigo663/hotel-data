# Hotel Data: Cleaning and Vizualization

In this project we take real [data](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand) from a hotel in order to make insightful vizualizations.
But first thing needs to be done is to clean the file hotel_booking_data.xlsx. You achieve it by running cleanup.ipynb, which yield the cleaned file cleaned.xlsx. HereÂ´s what happen during the cleanup:

###### Replace the missing data in columns 'company' and 'agent' with 'Nonexistent'
